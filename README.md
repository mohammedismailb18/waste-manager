This is a simple waste management web application created using HTML, CSS, Javascript.

Backend developed using NodeJS.

Database developed using MongoDB.

The user can sign up account and fill the forms to inform the waste details to the authorities.

These details will be sended to the admin.

I have also created a simple admin page where it displays all the waste details sended by various users.
